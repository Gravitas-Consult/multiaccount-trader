                MultiAccount Trader is a 100% cloud-based copier system, designed to allow you the management of multiple trade accounts simultaneously, independent of the Broker(s) you are using, in an ultra-low latency environment. Be sure that all high-frequency trading strategies are welcome!
            </p>
            <p class="lead">
                Simply speaking, your trade accounts will be logged in into our cloud based multiaccount trader software. You choose the risk measurements and capital allocation methods (no need for you to use an expensive VPS or overload your computer with platforms). After that, every order you give on your Master Account -independent of the platform you are using or your physical distance to your broker’s data center - will be replicated in a few milliseconds.

                            Even if installed on a low latency VPS, most Copier EA’s end up presenting a >1sec latency due to the communication time between the platform running the EA and the EA’s main receiver server, and due to delays on execution for overstretched VPS memory usage. With our MultiAccount Trader, both these issues are solved!

                            For effectively running a Copier EA you need to invest in a lot of things which will be expensive for you: subscribing to 1 or several costly VPS services, plus guaranteeing they are always updated, safe and well serviced. The large majority of traders end up not doing this, which might translate into enormously expensive issues. With MultiAccount Trader, all your needs and requirements are included so you don’t need to worry about anything.

                            It can become a nightmare to control dozens of running MT4 platforms at the same time. Especially if you run all of them with individual Copier EA’s as  well. By doing so, you induce yourself into repetitive work of EA parametrization and account control, opening doors to human errors that can end up being fatal for your trading. With MultiAccount Trader, all that workload is automatized. You can fully focus on what matters: your trading.

                            All Copier EA’s need to be parametrized after installation, directly on the EA page at your MT4. As such, in case any issue happens with your EA parametrization either through Live Update errors or other unforeseeable scenario, the consequences can be dire. By using our services, you protect yourself from these issues.

This might happen due to several factors, such but not limited to connection failure on the platforms, issue with EA parametrization or invalid pricing. Our innovative Trade ID system avoids  these situations so no trades will be left behind.
